Sky High Islands - Ludum Dare 49

# Short Description

Welcome to Sky High Islands, the most luxurious escape room among the clouds.

Our offer contains dangerous cliffs, collapsing bridges and lots of explosions.
Just make sure you have a firm tread - there is no safety net!

# Long Description

Collect items such as wood, stone and explosives to build yourself a path from island to island.
If you reach the goal post you will be teleported to the next world, with yet another puzzle to complete.
Once you pickup an item, you can place them back down as items or place them as a building block to step on.
You can pickup only one item at a time and cannot walk over items.
Wooden bridges start to decay once you walk onto them, lasting only a little while.
Stone bridges start to decay as soon as you spawn on the island / place it, but last much longer than wooden bridges.
Make sure to pickup your dynamite, as you need to clear some rocks along the way.
